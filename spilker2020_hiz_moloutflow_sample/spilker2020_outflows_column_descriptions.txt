This file gives more details about all the quantities given in the other three files.

Spilker2020_ouflows_mostuseful.txt
My guess for what people will find are the most useful values from all tables in both papers.
- Source        string          unitless
  SPT source name
- outflow       boolean         unitless
  True if source has an unambiguous molecular outflow, see Paper I S3.2.
- zlens         float           unitless
  Foreground lens redshift, if known.
- zsrc          float           unitless
  Background source redshift, from CO/CII/OH/other ALMA spectra.
- mu            float           unitless
  Gravitational lensing magnification in the 119um continuum. Uncertainty ~15%.
- LIR, dLIR     float           Lsun
  IR luminosity, lensing-corrected, integrated over rest-frame 8-1000um.

- fAGN          float           unitless
  Estimated AGN contribution to the total luminosity L_bol. These are *all* 1sigma upper limits,
  we have no evidence for AGN in any source. Following the low-z literature, we take L_bol = 1.15*L_IR,
  with L_AGN = fAGN * L_bol and L_SF = (1 - fAGN) * L_bol
- MH2, dMH2     float           Msun
  Molecular gas mass, lensing-corrected, from CO(2-1) spectra using r_21 = 0.9 and alpha_CO = 0.8.
- rdust         float           kpc
  Circularized radius of the 119um dust continuum emission, defined as the region where continuum
  is detected at S/N > 5. Uncertainty ~15%.
- v50, dv50     float           km/s
  Median absorption velocity of the OH spectra, i.e. if you take just one OH doublet component, 50%
  of the absorption takes place at velocities more negative than this.
- v84, dv84     float           km/s
  Same as v50, but for the 84th percentile absorption velocity, i.e. 16% of the absorption is at 
  more negative velocities than this.
- vmax, dvmax   float           km/s
  Same as v84, but for the 'maximum' absorption velocity that we take to be the 98th percentile.
- Mdotout etc.  float           Msun/yr
  Joint 'best' molecular outflow rates from combining all methods. dMdotout_m and _p are the minus/plus 
  uncertainties, i.e. they give the 16/84th percentile confidence intervals.
- Mout etc.     float           Msun
  Total molecular outflow masses, uncertainties as for Mdotout.
- pout          float           g*cm/s

  Outflow kinetic power (= 1/2 Mdotout vout^2), finally back to useful units. Uncertainty ~0.4dex.



Spilker2020_ouflows_OH_observables.txt
Derived and fit parameters from the OH spectra. The last ~18 columns contain
the actual Gaussian fit parameters to the spectra in case you want to recreate
any other derived property.
- Source        string          unitless
  SPT source name
- outflow       boolean         unitless
  True if source has an unambiguous molecular outflow, see Paper I S3.2.
- zsrc          float           unitless
  Background source redshift, from CO/CII/OH/other ALMA spectra.
- v50, dv50     float           km/s
  Median absorption velocity of the OH spectra, i.e. if you take just one OH doublet component, 50%
  of the absorption takes place at velocities more negative than this.
- v84, dv84     float           km/s
  Same as v50, but for the 84th percentile absorption velocity, i.e. 16% of the absorption is at 
  more negative velocities than this.
- vmax, dvmax   float           km/s
  Same as v84, but for the 'maximum' absorption velocity that we take to be the 98th percentile.
- EQW_v100 etc  float           km/s
  Equivalent width integrated from -infinity to -100km/s based on the Gaussian fits.
- EQW_v200 etc  float           km/s
  Equivalent width integrated from -infinity to -200km/s based on the Gaussian fits.
- EQW_totabs    float           km/s
  Total absorption equivalent width from the fits, *for one single OH doublet transition*,
  i.e. if you want the real total equivalent width, multiply by 2.
The remaining columns give all the fitted parameters from the Gaussian fitting, see Paper I S3.1.
Basically all the spectra are fit with 1 or 2 sets of two equal-amplitude Gaussians with a separation
fixed to the separation of the two OH doublet components (~520km/s) plus a constant continuum. These
are *not* corrected for the lensing magnification, they are purely the observed quantities.
- Scont119      float           mJy
  Continuum flux density at rest-frame 119um
- Comp?vcen     float           km/s
  Center velocities (relative to the higher-frequency OH doublet component) of the sets of
  Gaussians. For some sources one component was fixed to systemic velocity (0 km/s), and others
  don't need a second component (have all nan's for the Comp2 parameters).
- Comp?Sabs     float           mJy
  Amplitude of the Gaussian absorption profiles.
- Comp?FWHM     float           km/s
  FWHM of the Gaussian absorption profiles.
- Comp?EQW      float           km/s
  Equivalent width of one of the two doublet lines (i.e. for the total EQW must multiply by 2).



Spilker2020_outflows_alloutflowrates.txt
Basically just Table 1 from Paper II almost verbatim. Note that I give outflow rates even for
sources that do not have unambiguous outflows. All of the methods in Paper II can/do/will spit 
out an outflow rate based on the observables, even if a particular source doesn't have an 
outflow (see long discussion in Paper I for what constitutes an outflow). Instead you should use 
the 'outflow' True/False column to remove the sources that don't show an outflow. Why did I do 
this? (a) it makes the table much simpler, (b) we did detect OH in all sources and at some level 
which ones have an outflow or not is well, just, like, my opinion, man, and maybe you have a 
different opinion or you're from the future and know that some source I thought was ambiguous 
really does have a true outflow.
- Source        string          unitless

  Outflow rates assuming optically-thin absorption. These are bare-minimum lower limits. See S3.1.
- Mdot_thincorr float           Msun/yr
  Outflow rates trying to 'correct' the optically-thin rates using the outflow velocities. See S3.1.
- Mdot_S18      float           Msun/yr
  Outflow rates a la Spilker+2018, which assumes Mdot \propto EQW_v100 alone. See S3.2.
- Mdot_HC20     float           Msun/yr
  Outflow rates a la Herrera-Camus+2020, which assumes Mdot \propto EQW_v200 * sqrt(L_IR). See S3.2.
- Mdot_PLS      float           Msun/yr
  Outflow rates using the more complicated PLS technique. See S3.3.
- Mdot_joint    float           Msun/yr
  The joint / 'best' outflow rates from combining all methods. These are the same as the columns
  labeled 'Mdotout' in the _mostuseful.txt file. See S3.4.

  Total molecular outflow masses assuming the best/joint Mdot's.
