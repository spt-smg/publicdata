=======================================

In this paper we present resolved metallicity maps for two lensed dust-obscured star forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z~4, using JWST/NIRSpec data from the TEMPLATES ERS program. The maps are derived by combining resolved measurements of the [NII]/H-alpha flux ratio with optical line-metallicity calibrations from the literature. We also compare the integrated metallicity measurements with predictions from the mass-metallicity relation and fundamental metallicity relation. Finally, we utilize ALMA rest-frame 380um continuum and [CI] data to estimate the spatial variation of the gas-to-dust ratio in the two DSFGs, finding this to be anticorrelated with the metallicity on ~kpc scales.
