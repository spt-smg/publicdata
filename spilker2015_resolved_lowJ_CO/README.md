![alphaCO and Kennicutt-Schmidt](Fig67_highz_alphaCO_KS.png)

In this paper we presented spatially-resolved imaging of low-J CO lines in two
lensed dusty star-forming galaxies. We constrained the infamous CO-H2 conversion 
factor in multiple independent ways and found good agreement between the methods. 
We found that the CO emission was more spatially extended than the dust 
continuum -- a finding that's been corroborated by a number of studies since we 
published this work. As a result of the difference in the size of the emitting
region, we made the point that galaxies would move leftwards in a Kennicutt-Schmidt
plot, because the gas surface densities are actually lower in reality than if you
assumed a size measured at some other wavelength.

The [high-z alphaCO](highz_alphco.txt) file contains the compilation of all the 
CO-H2 conversion factor constraints I assembled for high-redshift galaxies, used
in Figure 6. No doubt there are more objects with alphaCO estimates by now, but
this is probably a good starting point.
