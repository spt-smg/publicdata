In this paper, we present the full stacked sub/mm spectrum of 78 of the SPT DSFG catalog (all DSFGs with 3mm ALMA spectra).  This paper is essentially an update from the original stacked spectrum presented in [Spilker et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785..149S/abstract) of 22 high-redshift dusty galaxies based on Cycle 0 ALMA 3mm data.  In subsequent years, we have been able to get 3mm spectra (and redshifts) for the complete sample of SPT DSFGs, which were presented in [Reuter et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200614060R/abstract).  In this update, we revisited Justin's faint line analysis, and CO SLEDs.  

This repo contains the stacked spectrum (Fig. 4), the faint lines (Table B1) and the updated CO SLED (from Fig. 5) from Reuter et al. 2023.
